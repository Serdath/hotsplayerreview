<h1 class="tier-heading">Heroes of the Storm Players</h1>
<p class="tier-description">This tier list is purely subjective and depends on my experience playing with that player. I won't talk about people with whom I have never played nor the one I have too few games to conduct a proper review.</p>
<p class="tier-description">My IGN is : DarkPrelateZ and I am currently playing in EU server. I identify myself as a hardcore player, always strive to become better at this game and take most of the matches I participate in seriously. It doesn't mean that I don't know how to have fun or troll but only when victory is assured. It is a game afterall and having fun is the utmost priority. But it is also a team game so makes sure your goal in a match aligns with other players. You may have fun by trolling but not every one in the team thinks the same.
<p class="tier-description">My highest rank achieved is GrandMaster 18: 8148RP. My moto is : Everyone makes mistakes so every game is winnable, it depends on if you truly want to win or not or if your mentality is steady enough to think through during the struggle.
    <p class="tier-description">This is not really a tier list but rather my review list requested by one of my friend because they are curious about my perspective of everyone.

                Oh my, she is by far the best gamer girl I have ever met in any game I play. She will not only charm you with her frenchy voice but also enthrall you with the high master display of skills gameplay with her Chromie and Whitemane being respected by almost every Storm League players. Talking to her is like swaying through a meadow of flowers, filling you with nothing but tranquility and joy. You could say I am being hypnotized by her and I am not going to deny that, gaming with her is the most euphoric moment of my life.

                He is by far the most conscious Quick Match player I have ever met. Despite playing only Tychus and sometimes Butcher, He is willing to do whatever necessary to facilitate team's advantages by soaking or taking camps if his teammates happen to drown in ARAM too much. He also displays exceptional skills and adaptabilities with his favorite hero Tychus so you can always be assured he is fulfilling his role competently. From my experience, he is a hardcore player, focuses on winning rather than messing around and trolling, just like my style. I enjoy playing with him.

                His Chromie is quite impressive, and he is an outgoing person, evident by constantly spamming emote at the start and at the end of the game. He also asks me (or you) nicely to join his lobby sometimes, which is appreciated instead of immediately inviting the player. He loves hunting Abathur and will gladly dive a fort to do so. Although sometimes by doing those risky moves, he forgets to soak, clear waves, and maybe even die. Still, he makes up for his shortcomings by timing his Time Traps perfectly to save his teammates multiple times. I enjoy playing in the same lobby with him.

                 Well, candidly, this review list is heavily inspired by his hots player tier list. Even though I agree with most of his opinions about the players that I have been through with, I feel like he is a little too bit harsh on judging some of them whether through his third party or his own experience. I guess he is just like me, always takes the game in a serious manner and would love to have every match played and executed close to perfection, play this game the way it is meant to be played but his experiences with those players were not as pleasant as mine, I am not so sure but as his demandings are high, he backs it up with his own skills, displaying profound knowledge of the game, hero's capabilities with his exemplary Brightwing and consistency overall. My experience with him so far has been mostly amiable exchanges of banter and gossip about the depraving state of quick match. I enjoy playing with him.

I will never forget the first captain who accepted me into his team when I first came to HeroesLounge specifically and Hots overall. I believe I have never heard an anger or an upset in his voice throughout the period I talked to him. He is the glue of my first team, literally and figuratively, connecting me to the rest of his russian's speakers teammates as well as the shotcaller in game. You can always hear his laugh while talking and he will listen without judging you hastily resulting in harmony in every conversation or conflict you may have with him. I am still curious about his IRL face, he must look kind and gentle but I guess I could always ask him for on and he would agree to it. About his skills, he was and is the most consistent players in my old team in addition to quite resistant to tilt though I have seen him being in one before. He can flex in any role and fulfil his duty quite adeptly but his introduction to me with Medivh was what amazed me the most. Gaming experience with him will never result in drama or conflict because he will eventually scoff it off and blame it " unlucky " if it happens to be a loss. What a wholesome man.

                Despite maining a toxic hero like Valeera, she is a friendly person to talk to and has also exceptional skills with her favorite heroes. However, as you can expect from a Valeera player, she will sit in one place and try to assassinate stragglers rather than do camp and soak wave although she will still do so if she can't find an opportunity or their composition counters her but hey, that is what valeera's playstyle is and is good at so she is in character, no complaints. Her other heroes's skills range from decent to abysmal so expect her to int most of the time when she is not on her main. I like playing with her.

                Quite skillful player although sometimes I feel like some of his deaths could have been prevented had he been more cautious and respectful to enemy's capabilities. Nevertherless, he is an outgoing and cordial person who won't hesitate to lengthen a conversation to talk and share information with you. His Medivh impresses me the most but he is also adept at other heroes as well. I haven't been on the field with him much but I would love to get more.

                 She is a really sweet girl and angelic like her main hero Tyrande. I remember having met her and her husband " Johnny " when I first returned to Hots due to nostalgia and they added me immediately after one game. Her skill level is average: I would say silver at most but playing with her is more of a relaxing experience because of her low MMR and her benign personality rather than a try hard one. She seems to never get angry or upset despite getting numerous and devastating losses plus encountering plethora of insufferable players. However, what surprises me the most is her core knowledge of the game in spite of being a silver, she will constantly ping to take camps, soak waves, gank lanes somethings that I find very admirable of her trying to improve herself; the quality that even most plat/diamond players lack or regard as inconsequential. I would love to be in her lobby when I want to chill.

                 He is the spouse of Praline if what I heard from them was correct. Together, They have been duoing through the hell of quick matches and still finding this game enjoyable which astounds me with their echelon of MMR. He likes split pushing, maining Sylvanas/Dehaka and showing off, probably to his lovely wife but due to lacking necessary skills, he often ends up hitting the dirt before his foe. He is, for the most part, as chill as his partner, though sometimes I have seen him displaying toxicity. I am hesitant between Neutral and like playing with him but because usually he duos with Praline, I will put him in my more favorable tier.

              As far as I remember, Sky is someone who would not hurt an ant and quite enjoyable to accompany during your quick match journey. His skills are quite decent with Brightwing/Gul'dan being the most played hero during my time with him but I haven't seen his other heroes yet. I frankly don't know what else to say about him anymore, he is your better and friendlier average heroes of the storm enjoyer so you will surely have a good time playing with as I do.

               Personally, I feel like he really likes playing with me and has said that he also tries to practice English with me which I always appreciate coming from a man with slavic origin. He is the second member of my old team that I got really close to and we have been playing together for quite a long time with him currently holding the most games played with me in HeroesProfile. Despite that, I have to admit I have seen him displaying extreme toxicity to his teammates not only in game but in voice chat as well which is not something I advocate, especially being quite rude and disrespectful to women. His skills are present and quite impressive, however, like Nofeedtoday, his decision and observation in addition to his thirst for play making have led to countlessly pointless deaths and further dampened his team's pressure advantage. He will int quite hard in StormLeauge when facing more disciplined people, the same case with Nofeedtoday which I find it weird that every team has to have at least 1 person like this. To me, I like playing with him in QM and Aram but not in Storm League and because he has almost never been rude or loud to me, his accompany is far more fruitful than other people may have experienced.

                I have heard and understood a lot of people complaining about her abusing the Match Making and playing in a specific composition to win games easily and boost her winrates. In my eyes, she uses and plays what the game has to offer and it is completely fine to me as long as she has fun and doesn't personally interfere with anyone else. Although there were a few times I solo queued against her stack with 4 randoms and had kinda mix opinions about the game: The randoms were so incompetent and oblivious that they really deserved to lose, but some of the stack 5 players also played so poorly ( Twister/Ripers ) that should have been punished severely but got away with that anyway due to the former reasons as well as having good team composition and coordination. I have never seen her play another hero except Abathur so I can't say much about her overall skill levels but her abathur is only good because I have seen better. Playing in her lobby can be quite stressful because she won't tolerate a lost game but chances are you won't be playing in her lobby if she doesn't trust you. I digress with a neutral.

            <div class="description">
            He is one of my HeroesLounge teammates and the one who first added me and got me into his team when he was scrimming against my old team. He is friendly, talkative and always tries his best to keep the lobby connected. He is willing to listen to your opinions as well as sharing his own knowledge of the game. However, his gameplay is questionable; there were multiple occassions when I couldn't understand what he was thinking by dying randomly somewhere on the map trying to make a play. He still doesn't understand that however perfect opportunity he thinks it is, if his teammates can't capitalize or are unaware of that, HE SHOULD NOT COMMIT to the play. He is a very competent player, I don't deny that but his decision making and his observation are much worse than I anticipated. The fact that I have more wins soloing Storm League than duoing with him puts a question to his consistency. If we don't play Storm League, he will be a completely perfect partner to queue with. Neutral is my placement for him since I kinda have higher expectation of him.

                 He is a prime paragon of an eagerly enthusiastic student ready to learn and improve his gameplay. I remember him asking me in Private Message after any game we lost if he had done the right thing and looked for my council and recommendation; that he would be grateful and receptive to any advice I have, implore me to not be hesitant to point out his error. I still regret that I had ignored most of his pmS due to being upset about losing and staining my kda/winrate. His Garrosh and Ragnaros were heavily flawed but I shouldn't have turned away from a man who made mistakes and sought to overcome them. He is the first case I have to adjust my opinion due to recent confrontation with him and I feel like he has been diminishing his skills to even worse as well as getting a little more cocky. It certainly didn't leave me with good impressions any more.

                He is friendly, he will ask you if you want to join his lobby, or if you are free to do so. He will send proper replies when you tell him you are busy doing somethings like eating or playing custom games. However, I am quite disheartened to say his Rehgar is absolutely mediorce at best, appalling at worst : His talent choices are questionable, he lacks necessary micro skills to pilot and become a good healer, he lacks macro skills to do camps or soak waves which his hero is the best healer to do so. It is really hard for me to decide in this case but currently I don't like playing with him.

                I haven't played much with him recently but deep inside I know why. He has skills as a healer, he knows basic heroes of the storm knowledge but what I feel intolerable from him is his constant trolling, B-stepping, intentionally getting hit by skillshots and spread to teammates if possible. He mains Kharazim as far as I remember so it is quite easy for him to do so. If that is how he enjoys the game, and if you also have fun by doing so then it is fine, he is your potential partner. I personally don't like playing with him.

              He is among many players with decent skills that enters a match with the mindset of wanting to both have fun and win which is only applicable if his opponents are your average random quick match players. Against a team with equal or more skills or a team in stack, he will struggle to relinquish his stapled mindset and to actually play the game instead of b-stepping, messing around, texting in chat like usual ; an epitome of the proverb " They don't cry until they see the coffin ". To me, he is just another stagnant, for-fun player that will never get better with his current playstyle and mindset; and he talks a lot of gibberish. Perfect partner for most player base, not for me.

             I may look like a jerk for writing about people I have already unfriended but those are people I had played with enough to make the decision why I don't like playing with them. Recent matches have shown me that he has been improving his gameplay since I last met him but still, he thought that I was mad at him for one specific game he played poorly that led me to remove him but I have been judging his gameplay since the beginning and reaching a conclusion that his skill is above average at best with the common symptoms of a quick match player such  as overextending, araming without rest, not understanding or fulfilling their roles. I wouldn't say he is a friendly figure but he is rather opinionate about his gameplay and other people's suggestion. The game that made me reach my boiling was the game where he played tank Varian and soloed frontline instead of peeling for his 3 dps backlines, he said he couldn't peel for everyone but every teamfight he walked up to taunt a whitemane in the middle of their teams while Mephisto and Zeratul jumped to his backline and wiped all of his teammates. He was denying and is still denying that there was nothing he could have done to prevent his teammates's deaths after I told him what needed to be done in that game plethora of times and that type of obstinate person is the one who will never learn and improve - the type I detest the most. Although he has shown sign of improvements, I still have yet a good time playing with him.

                Frankly, I have never heard him talk or just talk very little, I don't remember anymore as I have removed him from my friendlist a long time ago. He possesses decent knowledge about his main hero : Artanis but the worst part is he is too aggressive with his hero leading to many pointless deaths just because he decides to overstay and fight to his last breath instead of running away. Without a proper team to support his recklessness, I doubt he will have many wins on his own. He is not someone you want to play with if you can't or don't want to support him at a moment's notice. And oh, what is macro play when he just arams all days to stack his quest. I hate playing with him.

                Meat is not the friendliest person I have ever met nor does he have any outstanding skills worth mentioning. In fact his Butcher and Kerrigan combining with his impatience and agressiveness leave him farmable by even the most random quick match team. Usually after a loss with him having the most deaths, he will quit the lobby without saying anything, makes me feel like he is actually self-aware of his current state. Overall, I didn't have good gaming time with him and neither did I find any redeeming quality to keep him as a friend.

                Let's just say his playstyle and my playstyle are like water and fire. He loves trolling, donating his hp for free as Mal'ganis while his healer works his ass off to keep everyone in his team top-up, indirectly wasting the healing from his healer that could have been distributed to someone else wanting to stay alive. His gameplay is rash and brash, selfish relying on his swap health ult in order to get away with his imbecile actions without considering that a single interuption from cc would snap him back to the reality of keeping his green bar filled as same as his opponent's. Talking non-sense most of the time, posting his obstentatious Blind-as-Bat bullying some random quick match silver-gold players on reddit, the thought of these players existing is repugnant. Sure he will have fun doing these " comedic " acts, just hope he will find enough clowns to join his circus.

             I don't remember where and when I added this guy, probably through a third party because I would never have accepted his friend request had I seen him play and talk like in a recent match. Xul is one of the weakest, most kiteable early game hero in this game and like every late game hero, the only way to make them useful during the early stage is to have them soak and do camps which are non-hazard activities that can still contribute to the team. Instead, he went to soak for 1,2 waves, refused to do camps because " he is Xul ", then joined the tank/healer in araming mid as well as ran around the map aimlessly like a headless chicken. Later on he claimed " You blame it on me being useless but there were 2 people sitting mid the whole game doing nothing "; If you ever read this review list of mine, answer me a question " If you saw your friends steal and rob a convenience store, would you follow them? ". Just because they are your teammates and are doing something wrong doesn't mean you have to follow them , you can control no teammate's hero but your own, do what you think is best for the team. You are even worse than the random Nazeebo I had who constantly pushed a lane and didn't give a fuck about everything else because he actually pressured the enemy core instead of embellishing his kda and stat. Can't cure stupidity.
