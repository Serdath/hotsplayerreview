<p class="tier-description">This tier list is purely subjective and depends on my experience playing with that player. I won't talk about people with whom I have never played nor the one I have too few games to conduct a proper review.</p>
<p class="tier-description">My IGN is : DarkPrelateZ/Serdath and I am currently playing in EU server. I identify myself as a hardcore player, always strive to become better at this game and take most of the matches I participate in seriously. It doesn't mean that I don't know how to have fun or troll but only when victory is assured. It is a game afterall and having fun is the utmost priority. But it is also a team game so makes sure your goal in a match aligns with other players. You may have fun by trolling but not every one in the team thinks the same.
<p class="tier-description">My moto is : Everyone makes mistakes so every game is winnable, it depends on  if your mentality is steady enough to think through during the struggle.
<p class="tier-description">This is not really a tier list but rather my review list requested by one of my friend because they are curious about my perspective of everyone. Well Twice now ( 25/09/2024 Updated )
<p class="tier-description">By the time I added this line, I had already purged my friendlist as I felt I had had too much leniency allowing people to ruin my gaming experience and show their true colors. The more you take, the less you have; the less you have, the more you appreciate. Quality over quantity.

               He is still my only idol in this game because he is the epitome of what I envision in other players : A revered good hearted chill gifted guy who has done so much to support this game as well as its community. I have been watching him everyday since he was introduced to me by Robikenobi who is also a cordial teammate of mine and He just has every quality of someone worth keeping friend. People can say I am obsessed with him because I am, considering the fact that the amount of people like him in this community is few and far between. Seeing him in my lobby will always bring a smile to me whether I am against or with his team because I know I am going to have some fun, more or less in that game. I long for the day to meet him IRL.

               I have only met and played with/against him in SL, almost never talked or interacted but he seems to be a chill dude with some humors who plows hundred of SL games everyday to seek for Rank 1 Grandmaster. As the matter of fact, his skill and game sense are among top tier if not the best currently. Having him in your team will always guarantee a solid playmaker to lean on and he rarely displays toxic behavior ( Mostly B-step but when the game is completely oom ), most of the time just stay passive and quiet unless there is someone trying to be a smartass. Overall, I am always glad to see him on my team.

            <div class="description">
               Like most people's first impression with Tychessa, I once thought he was a boosted, toxic, insufferable player judged by his experience in Storm League. The banshee cup opened an opportunity for me to see him closer. After getting to play with and know him for some times, I discern that he is actually a nice funny guy with profound knowledge of the game in the aspect of drafting - counter pick - how to play the map - rotation etc... He has been silently teaching me a lot about the game at the tournament level that now I appreciate that I am able to compete more equally with the top-tier veteran players/teams. I also slowly realize that he is a peace-keeper when playing in a team and those toxic behaviors you see in SL don't exist when you are in communication with him. He is someone you have to get to know closer to figure out that he is a good person with high skill level that you will be able to learn a thing or two from him. Regarding to his toxic behaviors in SL, it is completely understandable when you put yourself in his shoes, a man with the game sense of top tier level playing in a diamond lobby where people are clueless about what needs to be done, I would be as frustrated as well although I am better at bottling it instead of venting all out like he does. People can dislike him however they want, he is one of few players I consider " My friend " in this hots community. And yes there are big differences between a friend and an acquaintance.

            <div class="description">
               At first, Hygao to me is like a myth through Tychessa's word when he told me that is the only reason why he is still playing Hots and this guy is insanely cracked at video games. I got to witness it myself sometime later when he started playing and streaming this game again and everything Tych said is true. Recently I have had the privilege to meet and talk with the legend himself and soon I learn that he and I have so much in common when it comes to the mentality of playing solo in this game and how observant he is when it comes to nuance things people do that are rarely noticeable and require a keen eye to spot. He sometimes loves discussing a hero or your talent choice specifically when you perform well with the said hero or talent. It is always a pleasure to see that someone who is already at the peak of this game is eager to learn more and is not hesitant to ask out other people's opinions and that is a trait of a great and successful player: Once a student, always a student. As you can expect, he is friendly, cordial and open-minded as well as has high resistance to tilt because no one is truly tilt-proof if they are human and I have had so much fun cage fighting and ranting with him in diamond lobbies simply because we have the same mindset that Hots can be fun when you suffer and lament with your friends

Engaging in a deep conversation with him is possible which is unprecedent to me with other French thus making him stand out from the rest. And I always highly value people who actively initiate a conversation as well as prolong it as much as possible as it shows their signs of respect and interest for the other party. He also told me a lot of stories about the past HGC, past players which I am grateful for the extra information and his commitment to our conversation. Pretty chill/amiable guy and high skill player, rare qualities to see in a French.

               I can't iterate how much he and Robikenobi have broken my stereotype of Russian players. The more I meet Robert's friends, The more I appreciate and am grateful that he and his team were the first one to open the door and introduce me to this game. Like Robert, He is capable of speaking fluent English which is a high plus from me and he is also a friendly teammate to play with decent skills on his main role tank. The thing I like the most about him is his habit of sending PM after every game we play together and saying " GG, Thanks for game ". I have never seen anyone doing that and it suddenly makes my day feel better when someone expresses their gratitude over such trivial things as playing games together and personally making me feel like he really enjoys my company with his team. When you have people like these, why would you even try to pursue the worse one who doesn't even care about your presence ?

                He is by far the most conscious Quick Match player I have ever met. Despite playing only Tychus and sometimes Butcher, He is willing to do whatever necessary to facilitate team's advantages by soaking or taking camps if his teammates happen to drown in ARAM too much. He also displays exceptional skills and adaptabilities with his favorite hero Tychus so you can always be assured he is fulfilling his role competently. From my experience, he is a hardcore player, focuses on winning rather than messing around and trolling, just like my style. I enjoy playing with him.

                His Chromie is quite impressive, and he is an outgoing person, evident by constantly spamming emote at the start and at the end of the game. He also asks me (or you) nicely to join his lobby sometimes, which is appreciated instead of immediately inviting the player. He loves hunting Abathur and will gladly dive a fort to do so. Although sometimes by doing those risky moves, he forgets to soak, clear waves, and maybe even die. Still, he makes up for his shortcomings by timing his Time Traps perfectly to save his teammates multiple times. I enjoy playing in the same lobby with him.

                  I will never forget the first captain who accepted me into his team when I first came to HeroesLounge specifically and Hots overall. I believe I have never heard an anger or an upset in his voice throughout the period I talked to him. He is the glue of my first team, literally and figuratively, connecting me to the rest of his russian's speaker teammates as well as the shotcaller in game. You can always hear his laugh while talking and he will listen without judging you hastily resulting in harmony in every conversation or conflict you may have with him. I am still curious about his IRL face, he must look kind and gentle but I guess I could always ask him for one and he would agree to it. About his skills, he was and is the most consistent player in my old team in addition to quite resistant to tilt though I have seen him being in one before. He can flex in any role and fulfil his duty quite adeptly but his introduction to me with Medivh was what amazed me the most. Gaming experience with him will never result in drama or conflict because he will eventually scoff it off and blame it " unlucky " if it happens to be a loss. What a wholesome man.

                Despite maining a toxic hero like Valeera, she is a friendly person to talk to and has also exceptional skills with her favorite heroes. However, as you can expect from a Valeera player, she will sit in one place and try to assassinate stragglers rather than do camp and soak wave although she will still do so if she can't find an opportunity or their composition counters her but hey, that is what valeera's playstyle is and is good at so she is in character, no complaint. Her other heroes's skills range from decent to abysmal so expect her to int most of the time when she is not on her main. The time I wrote these lines, I had been submerged deeply into the tournament environment and it is hard for me to tolerate any mistake especially the most fundamental and basic one. Unfortunately, she is not the one with that knowledge, not yet or never, I will never know.

                Chris is your convivial friend who will surely make your day feel better just by his existence alone. He will ask you out, gossip with you, wait for you just to get your game going together, wish you good night everything you want to see from your friends. He barely insults anyone, only says they are bad or afk but that is the common thing you will see if you are a QM enjoyer like him. His skill however is quite controversial to me as He is exceptionally good at his main heroes which are D.va and Deathwing but anything he plays outside from that, he looks like a completely different player in a bad way. Since he has never played Storm League or any competitive environment ( As far as I know ), I get frustrated at his movement and decision making in game sometimes and he also tends to introduce me to his stack 3 only with the 3rd player being the griefer and sub-consciously running games down while thinking it is fun. So far, I have yet seen or felt anything too obnoxious when playing with him and considering his personality, it is acceptable to me.

                Quite skillful player although sometimes I feel like some of his deaths could have been prevented had he been more cautious and respectful to enemy's capabilities. Nevertherless, he is an outgoing and cordial person who won't hesitate to lengthen a conversation to talk and share information with you. His Medivh impresses me the most but he is also adept at other heroes as well. I haven't been on the field with him much but I would love to get more.

                 She is a really sweet girl and angelic like her main hero Tyrande. I remember having met her and her husband " Johnny " when I first returned to Hots due to nostalgia and they added me immediately after one game. Her skill level is average: I would say silver at most but playing with her is more of a relaxing experience because of her low MMR and her benign personality rather than a try hard one. She seems to never get angry or upset despite getting numerous and devastating losses plus encountering plethora of insufferable players. However, what surprises me the most is her core knowledge of the game in spite of being a silver, she will constantly ping to take camps, soak waves, gank lanes somethings that I find very admirable of her trying to improve herself; the quality that even most plat/diamond players lack or regard as inconsequential. I would love to be in her lobby when I want to chill.

                 He is the spouse of Praline if what I heard from them was correct. Together, They have been duoing through the hell of quick matches and still finding this game enjoyable which astounds me with their echelon of MMR. He likes split pushing, maining Sylvanas/Dehaka and showing off, probably to his lovely wife but due to lacking necessary skills, he often ends up hitting the dirt before his foe. He is, for the most part, as chill as his partner, though sometimes I have seen him displaying toxicity. I am hesitant between Neutral and like playing with him but because usually he duos with Praline, I will put him in my more favorable tier.

I frankly don't know what else to say about him anymore, he is your better and friendlier average heroes of the storm enjoyer so you will surely have a good time playing with as I do.

               Personally, I feel like he really likes playing with me and has said that he also tries to practice English with me which I always appreciate coming from a man with slavic origin. He is the second member of my old team that I got really close to and we have been playing together for quite a long time with him currently holding the most games played with me in HeroesProfile. Despite that, I have to admit I have seen him displaying extreme toxicity to his teammates not only in game but in voice chat as well which is not something I advocate, especially being quite rude and disrespectful to women. His skills are present and quite impressive, however, like Nofeedtoday, his decision and observation in addition to his thirst for play making have led to countlessly pointless deaths and further dampened his team's pressure advantage. He will int quite hard in StormLeague when facing more disciplined people, the same case with Nofeedtoday which I find it weird that every team has to have at least 1 person like this. To me, I like playing with him in QM and Aram but not in Storm League and because he has almost never been rude or loud to me, his accompany is far more fruitful than other people may have experienced.

From my experience, he is also perceptive and will voice his concern for other people's problem and that I always appreciate and value highly due to how rare it is to witness such quality in a normal human being nowadays. I just wish he had more slots for me to play with him though.

                 Well, candidly, this review list is heavily inspired by his hots player tier list. Even though I agree with most of his opinions about the players that I have been through with, I feel like he is a little bit too harsh on judging some of them whether through his third party or his own experience. I guess he is just like me, always takes the game in a serious manner and would love to have every match played and executed close to perfection, play this game the way it is meant to be played but his experiences with those players were not as pleasant as mine, I am not so sure but as his demandings are high, he backs it up with his own skills, displaying profound knowledge of the game, hero's capabilities with his exemplary Brightwing and consistency overall. My experience with him so far has been mostly amiable exchanges of banter and gossip about the depraving state of quick match. I enjoy playing with him.

                I have heard and understood a lot of people complaining about her abusing the Match Making and playing in a specific composition to win games easily and boost her winrates. In my eyes, she uses and plays what the game has to offer and it is completely fine to me as long as she has fun and doesn't personally interfere with anyone else. Although there were a few times I solo queued against her stack with 4 randoms and had kinda mix opinions about the game: The randoms were so incompetent and oblivious that they really deserved to lose, but some of the stack 5 players also played so poorly ( Twister/Ripers ) that should have been punished severely but got away with that anyway due to the former reasons as well as having good team composition and coordination. I have never seen her play another hero except Abathur so I can't say much about her overall skill levels but her abathur is only good because I have seen better. Playing in her lobby can be quite stressful because she won't tolerate a lost game but chances are you won't be playing in her lobby if she doesn't trust you. I digress with a neutral.

            He is one of my HeroesLounge teammates and the one who first added me and got me into his team when he was scrimming against my old team. He is friendly, talkative and always tries his best to keep the lobby connected. He is willing to listen to your opinions as well as sharing his own knowledge of the game. However, his gameplay is questionable; there were multiple occassions when I couldn't understand what he was thinking by dying randomly somewhere on the map trying to make a play. He still doesn't understand that however perfect opportunity he thinks it is, if his teammates can't capitalize or are unaware of that, HE SHOULD NOT COMMIT to the play. He is a very competent player, I don't deny that but his decision making and his observation are much worse than I anticipated. The fact that I have more wins soloing Storm League than duoing with him puts a question to his consistency. If we don't play Storm League, he will be a completely perfect partner to queue with. Neutral is my placement for him since I kinda have higher expectation of him.

            He is by no mean a bad player nor a bad person. I had quite a slightly annoyed experience with him during the banshee cup and what frustrated me the most is his unwilling to learn and watch replays to figure out the mistake / problem as well as his disregard to minor action/detail that would matter. He on his main role healer is a good player and I admit that but on any other roles, it is most likely not the same and recently I have seen him displaying his toxicity in SL chat and in public chat which I don't know if he has done before or not but It seems he got some beefs with other players he doesn't like and decides to vocalize it. Overall, I don't hate him nor do I have anything else to relate to him but my gratitude to his invitation to the banshee cup despite the many disagreements I had with him.

            <div class="description">
            Krankle is an anomaly to me in the way that I have never seen anyone like him before. His outgoing and carefree demeanor arouses quite mixed opinions about him : Some said he is a funny and entertaining guy, some said he is an annoying brat who loves running his mouth with impunity, some said he just wants the attention and fame for his career. My personal experience with him is that I think he is capable of reasoning, listening to different opinions and drops his trolling act to talk about a topic seriously. Sometimes I find him funny on stream, sometimes I find him annoying when he crosses the line by insulting a player personally or just toxic chatting in games which affects the quality of my games. I really can't describe how I feel about him, on one side, he is just a chill entertaining guy who loves creating drama to spice up the community and on another side, he can be very irritating to those who can't put up with his acting and dramatic talking. He personally hasn't done anything to me wrongly or caused me any annoyance, in fact, My SL with him so far has been quite fruitful except a few time he had beef with someone and decided to type the whole game instead of playing. His skill is questionable to me, He does good job on some heroes he mains but occasionally he will run down sub-consciously whether to make contents or not is beyond me.

             He is the first case I have to adjust my opinion due to recent confrontation with him and I feel like he has been diminishing his skills to even worse as well as getting a little more cocky. It certainly didn't leave me with good impressions any more.

                  He suffers the same issue that i think most players in Hots have: Decent Mechanic Skills, Little to no game/map knowledge. His movements are utterly atrocious; Multiple times he got caught out of positions resulting in unnecessary deaths and manpower disadvantage, his macro capability is green and limited. It is difficult for me to believe that he achieved the rank master with his current state as I expect Master players to not only possess good level of hero's micro but also map awareness, timing and decision making. I guess the standard for master rank is too low these days but it is just my opinion. Nonetheless, the good trait of him not fuming every game and admitting his mistakes is somethings worth applauding.

             An individual with decent skills but suffering the irreverent mentality like most people I have met : Bstep, /dance, /taunt, toying with the opponents or should I say bullying randoms silver/gold until he meets an actual team that will expose his mindless gameplay and his incompetency even after he turns " serious " to win the game. His rank hardstuck diamond/low Master in multiple account is enough to say anything more. Frankly, this review list has so many people with the same attitude towards their gameplays that until this point, it is rather dull and repetitive to write for each person. Personality wise, he is actually a friendly guy though with limited English level.

             I could just copy paste from " Rainred " and I still perfectly describe this player. The only thing different is this player is quite mysterious and moderately better at skills than Rainred but the rest applies fittingly. Apparently, this player is from Russia and has to google translate so most of the time, you won't understand much from " his " sentence. Don't know if this person is hypocrite or not, with friendly demeanors but rude actions but at this point, why do I still expect something good from Slavic people? ( Sorry Robikenobi ). Stacking to rank up in SL btw, not saying it is wrong or not allowed but it says something.

         I don't quite understand this guy that much as he is notorious for running people down in his Storm league game due to personal reasons, Some deserve some don't but I don't condone that action at all. He is surprisingly friendly to me whether in QM or in SL and has shown good demeanor and English level so I guess the time he ran the game down when i was in it was because of someone else and not me, I am not sure if he is pretentious, hypocrite or not but it doesn't matter to me. The way I see him, he is fine with his main heroes like Zuljin, Valla, Tychus, Zagara but apart from that, He can't play any other heroes so having him in your team can be very confining in hero pool but recently, every game he played with me, he at least showed that he tried to win and played as best as he could so maybe he has reformed and also I haven't seen him stacking much in SL so it is a good sign to me. He is staying at his rank where he is so I can't complain much about his skill. Astonishingly, he is more tolerable than someone that I used to think otherwise.

                I simply give up with this player no matter how hard I try to help them to at least get a better choice and be more respected instead of being hunted and ran down by other players. They still stack and smurf in elo lower than their rank with their group of friends that outrighly talk shit and trash them pubicly with the most illiterate , ill-mannered possible. I guess " you become just like the person you associate with/ you seek the person like who you are " and that speak volume of their personalities: Petty, Nescient and " Thick Face ". If you ever get smurfed by a Whitemane/Chromie/Ana in a stack 2+ around Diamond/Low-master or seen a diamond account duo with 5k master to boost that guy just like Raiku does, you know who that is. Deplorable, Disappointed and Speechless. Imagine saying GL without the HF because " you will probably need luck to win against us " level of pettiness, You either middle finger to my face or don't, don't have to show your pretentious friendliness. And nah, I don't need fun from your team nor do I need to prove anything by winning, I have fun playing with my friends, playing offrole, troll draft, first time a hero and still gap your entire existence. Funny how I was the last to be convinced that some people are beyond repair.

                He is friendly, he will ask you if you want to join his lobby, or if you are free to do so. He will send proper replies when you tell him you are busy doing somethings like eating or playing custom games. However, I am quite disheartened to say his Rehgar is absolutely mediorce at best, appalling at worst : His talent choices are questionable, he lacks necessary micro skills to pilot and become a good healer, he lacks macro skills to do camps or soak waves which his hero is the best healer to do so. It is really hard for me to decide in this case but currently I don't like playing with him.

                I haven't played much with him recently but deep inside I know why. He has skills as a healer, he knows basic heroes of the storm knowledge but what I feel intolerable from him is his constant trolling, B-stepping, intentionally getting hit by skillshots and spread to teammates if possible. He mains Kharazim as far as I remember so it is quite easy for him to do so. If that is how he enjoys the game, and if you also have fun by doing so then it is fine, he is your potential partner. I personally don't like playing with him.

              He is among many players with decent skills that enters a match with the mindset of wanting to both have fun and win which is only applicable if his opponents are your average random quick match players. Against a team with equal or more skills or a team in stack, he will struggle to relinquish his stapled mindset and to actually play the game instead of b-stepping, messing around, texting in chat like usual ; an epitome of the proverb " They don't cry until they see the coffin ". To me, he is just another stagnant, for-fun player that will never get better with his current playstyle and mindset; and he talks a lot of gibberish. Perfect partner for most player base, not for me.

             I may look like a jerk for writing about people I have already unfriended but those are people I had played with enough to make the decision why I don't like playing with them. Recent matches have shown me that he has been improving his gameplay since I last met him but still, he thought that I was mad at him for one specific game he played poorly that led me to remove him but I have been judging his gameplay since the beginning and reaching a conclusion that his skill is above average at best with the common symptoms of a quick match player such  as overextending, araming without rest, not understanding or fulfilling their roles. I wouldn't say he is a friendly figure but he is rather opinionate about his gameplay and other people's suggestion. The game that made me reach my boiling was the game where he played tank Varian and soloed frontline instead of peeling for his 3 dps backlines, he said he couldn't peel for everyone but every teamfight he walked up to taunt a whitemane in the middle of their teams while Mephisto and Zeratul jumped to his backline and wiped all of his teammates. He was denying and is still denying that there was nothing he could have done to prevent his teammates's deaths after I told him what needed to be done in that game plethora of times and that type of obstinate person is the one who will never learn and improve - the type I detest the most. Although he has shown sign of improvements, I still have yet a good time playing with him.

               The definition of " Aram Offlaner "; Although the hero he mains Samuro is good at offlaning, he never actually does his job as a solo laner and instead drips himself into endless brawling with little to no good outcome. His talent choices are also questionable and subsequently lead to many of his deaths. Decent mechanic skills, average to little game knowledge, whatever hero's role you see him play, don't expect him to fulfill that role and quite toxic as a form of passive aggressive as well.

            He is just another generic QM player who appears to be less braindead than other randoms because he plays in a stack. No concept of macro, no concepts of anything, just point and click or do random things until he realizes he has to be somewhere important then it is already too late. Nothing special to say about him.

                Frankly, I have never heard him talk or just talk very little, I don't remember anymore as I have removed him from my friendlist a long time ago. He possesses decent knowledge about his main hero : Artanis but the worst part is he is too aggressive with his hero leading to many pointless deaths just because he decides to overstay and fight to his last breath instead of running away. Without a proper team to support his recklessness, I doubt he will have many wins on his own. He is not someone you want to play with if you can't or don't want to support him at a moment's notice. And oh, what is macro play when he just arams all days to stack his quest. I hate playing with him.

                Meat is not the friendliest person I have ever met nor does he have any outstanding skills worth mentioning. In fact his Butcher and Kerrigan combining with his impatience and agressiveness leave him farmable by even the most random quick match team. Usually after a loss with him having the most deaths, he will quit the lobby without saying anything, makes me feel like he is actually self-aware of his current state. Overall, I didn't have good gaming time with him and neither did I find any redeeming quality to keep him as a friend.

The moment you are no longer on the same page with him, whether in gameplays or opinions, he will insult you without hesitation revealing his opportunistic and hypocritical personality. His Kerrigan is decent, better than Meat for sure, but will end up on a feeding frenzy when encountering decent players. I have nothing more to say about him rather than avoid this guy.

                Let's just say his playstyle and my playstyle are like water and fire. He loves trolling, donating his hp for free as Mal'ganis while his healer works his ass off to keep everyone in his team top-up, indirectly wasting the healing from his healer that could have been distributed to someone else wanting to stay alive. His gameplay is rash and brash, selfish relying on his swap health ult in order to get away with his imbecile actions without considering that a single interuption from cc would snap him back to the reality of keeping his green bar filled as same as his opponent's. Talking non-sense most of the time, posting his obstentatious Blind-as-Bat bullying some random quick match silver-gold players on reddit, the thought of these players existing is repugnant. Sure he will have fun doing these " comedic " acts, just hope he will find enough clowns to join his circus.

             I don't remember where and when I added this guy, probably through a third party because I would never have accepted his friend request had I seen him play and talk like in a recent match. Xul is one of the weakest, most kiteable early game hero in this game and like every late game hero, the only way to make them useful during the early stage is to have them soak and do camps which are non-hazard activities that can still contribute to the team. Instead, he went to soak for 1,2 waves, refused to do camps because " he is Xul ", then joined the tank/healer in araming mid as well as ran around the map aimlessly like a headless chicken. Later on he claimed " You blame it on me being useless but there were 2 people sitting mid the whole game doing nothing "; If you ever read this review list of mine, answer me a question " If you saw your friends steal and rob a convenience store, would you follow them? ". Just because they are your teammates and are doing something wrong doesn't mean you have to follow them , you can control no teammate's hero but your own, do what you think is best for the team. You are even worse than the random Nazeebo I had who constantly pushed a lane and didn't give a fuck about everything else because he actually pressured the enemy core instead of embellishing his kda and stat. Can't cure stupidity.

          From what I perceive, he is a close friend of " Witchet " and people are friend with those thinking alike and that should partially describe this player. He is like witchet except with much much worse skills and exhibits the 1vs5 syndrome with his awful Qhira gameplays that can only bleed your eyes. At this point I am just too tired to write about people who don't respect the integrity of a match as well as their opponents no matter how bad they are. People are just inherently unconsciously stupid that sometimes it doesn't worth talking about personalities with all you have to know.

           The only time you want to play with him is when your team captain tells you to do so because his mentality is as fragile as his ego. He won't vocally anathematize you but you will surely know when he is not happy and he will express his passive aggressive satire if people don't do what he expects them to do even without giving them any hint of his intention. He is just your average asshole player who has some skills plus past tournament experience and thinks he knows better and above everybody else. I don't know what Tychessa saw in him and said he is different IRL but for now, just avoid saying and typing anything to this guy cause he is already condescending you if he doesn't like you.

            I see no difference between these 2 players considering they are duoing most of the time and having the same personalities so I just gonna group them for a quick review. Like Johann, These 2 are occasionally passive aggressive and mostly aggressive in vocalizing their displease and frustration when things don't go their ways. The characteristic of these behaviors are clear as day : spamming ping, typing, b-stepping ( mental boom move ) and the most deplorable one is running down or intentional dying because they assume the game is over and they will decide the fate of other players themselves. I am not gonna call them because they are French so they have these qualities of an animal, I will indirectly insult other good French players I know but most of the French you encounter in this game are like these 2 players: Low to Mid skill, Fragile mentality, big ego and even a bigger mouth, no wonder they can play together and can only play together because the rest of community despises them. I doubt they will even ask themselves the question why their people have bad reputation in this game.
