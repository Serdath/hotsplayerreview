<p class="tier-description">This tier list is purely subjective and depends on my experience playing with that player. I won't talk about people with whom I have never played nor the one I have too few games to conduct a proper review.</p>
<p class="tier-description">My IGN is : DarkPrelateZ and I am currently playing in EU server. I identify myself as a hardcore player, always strive to become better at this game and take most of the matches I participate in seriously. It doesn't mean that I don't know how to have fun or troll but only when victory is assured. It is a game afterall and having fun is the utmost priority. But it is also a team game so makes sure your goal in a match aligns with other players. You may have fun by trolling but not every one in the team thinks the same.
<p class="tier-description">My highest rank achieved is GrandMaster 18: 8148RP. My moto is : Everyone makes mistakes so every game is winnable, it depends on if you truly want to win or not or if your mentality is steady enough to think through during the struggle.
    <p class="tier-description">This is not really a tier list but rather my review list requested by one of my friend because they are curious about my perspective of everyone.

                He is by far the most conscious Quick Match player I have ever met. Despite playing only Tychus and sometimes Butcher, He is willing to do whatever necessary to facilitate team's advantages by soaking or taking camps if his teammates happen to drown in ARAM too much. He also displays exceptional skills and adaptabilities with his favorite hero Tychus so you can always be assured he is fulfilling his role competently. From my experience, he is a hardcore player, focuses on winning rather than messing around and trolling, just like my style. I enjoy playing with him.

                His Chromie is quite impressive, and he is an outgoing person, evident by constantly spamming emote at the start and at the end of the game. He also asks me (or you) nicely to join his lobby sometimes, which is appreciated instead of immediately inviting the player. He loves hunting Abathur and will gladly dive a fort to do so. Although sometimes by doing those risky moves, he forgets to soak, clear waves, and maybe even die. Still, he makes up for his shortcomings by timing his Time Traps perfectly to save his teammates multiple times. I enjoy playing in the same lobby with him.

                 Well, candidly, this review list is heavily inspired by his hots player tier list. Even though I agree with most of his opinions about the players that I have been through with, I feel like he is a little too bit harsh on judging some of them whether through his third party or his own experience. I guess he is just like me, always takes the game in a serious manner and would love to have every match played and executed close to perfection, play this game the way it is meant to be played but his experiences with those players were not as pleasant as mine, I am not so sure but as his demandings are high, he backs it up with his own skills, displaying profound knowledge of the game, hero's capabilities with his exemplary Brightwing and consistency overall. My experience with him so far has been mostly amiable exchanges of banter and gossip about the depraving state of quick match. I enjoy playing with him.

                Despite maining a toxic hero like Valeera, she is a friendly person to talk to and has also exceptional skills with her favorite heroes. However, as you can expect from a Valeera player, she will sit in one place and try to assassinate stragglers rather than do camp and soak wave although she will still do so if she can't find an opportunity or their composition counters her but hey, that is what valeera's playstyle is and is good at so she is in character, no complaints. Her other heroes's skills range from decent to abysmal so expect her to int most of the time when she is not on her main. I like playing with her.

                Quite skillful player although sometimes I feel like some of his deaths could have been prevented had he been more cautious and respectful to enemy's capabilities. Nevertherless, he is an outgoing and cordial person who won't hesitate to lengthen a conversation to talk and share information with you. His Medivh impresses me the most but he is also adept at other heroes as well. I haven't been on the field with him much but I would love to get more.

             <div class="description">
                 She is a really sweet girl and angelic like her main hero Tyrande. I remember having met her and her husband " Johnny " when I first returned to Hots due to nostalgia and they added me immediately after one game. Her skill level is average: I would say silver at most but playing with her is more of a relaxing experience because of her low MMR and her benign personality rather than a try hard one. She seems to never get angry or upset despite getting numerous and devastating losses plus encountering plethora of insufferable players. However, what surprises me the most is her core knowledge of the game in spite of being a silver, she will constantly ping to take camps, soak waves, gank lanes somethings that I find very admirable of her trying to improve herself; the quality that even most plat/diamond players lack or regard as inconsequential. I would love to be in her lobby when I want to chill.

                 He is the spouse of Praline if what I heard from them was correct. Together, They have been duoing through the hell of quick matches and still finding this game enjoyable which astounds me with their echelon of MMR. He likes split pushing, maining Sylvanas/Dehaka and showing off, probably to his lovely wife but due to lacking necessary skills, he often ends up hitting the dirt before his foe. He is, for the most part, as chill as his partner, though sometimes I have seen him displaying toxicity. I am hesitant between Neutral and like playing with him but because usually he duos with Praline, I will put him in my more favorable tier.

                 He is a prime paragon of an eagerly enthusiastic student ready to learn and improve his gameplay. I remember him asking me in Private Message after any game we lost if he had done the right thing and looked for my council and recommendation; that he would be grateful and receptive to any advice I have, implore me to not be hesitant to point out his error. I still regret that I had ignored most of his pmS due to being upset about losing and staining my kda/winrate. His Garrosh and Ragnaros were heavily flawed but I shouldn't have turned away from a man who made mistakes and sought to overcome them. I would love to play in his lobby again given any chance.

                I have heard and understood a lot of people complaining about her abusing the Match Making and playing in a specific composition to win games easily and boost her winrates. In my eyes, she uses and plays what the game has to offer and it is completely fine to me as long as she has fun and doesn't personally interfere with anyone else. Although there were a few times I solo queued against her stack with 4 randoms and had kinda mix opinions about the game: The randoms were so incompetent and oblivious that they really deserved to lose, but some of the stack 5 players also played so poorly ( Twister/Ripers ) that should have been punished severely but got away with that anyway due to the former reasons as well as having good team composition and coordination. I have never seen her play another hero except Abathur so I can't say much about her overall skill levels but her abathur is only good because I have seen better. Playing in her lobby can be quite stressful because she won't tolerate a lost game but chances are you won't be playing in her lobby if she doesn't trust you. I digress with a neutral.

                He is friendly, he will ask you if you want to join his lobby, or if you are free to do so. He will send proper replies when you tell him you are busy doing somethings like eating or playing custom games. However, I am quite disheartened to say his Rehgar is absolutely mediorce at best, appalling at worst : His talent choices are questionable, he lacks necessary micro skills to pilot and become a good healer, he lacks macro skills to do camps or soak waves which his hero is the best healer to do so. It is really hard for me to decide in this case but currently I don't like playing with him.

                I haven't played much with him recently but deep inside I know why. He has skills as a healer, he knows basic heroes of the storm knowledge but what I feel intolerable from him is his constant trolling, B-stepping, intentionally getting hit by skillshots and spread to teammates if possible. He mains Kharazim as far as I remember so it is quite easy for him to do so. If that is how he enjoys the game, and if you also have fun by doing so then it is fine, he is your potential partner. I personally don't like playing with him.

                Frankly, I have never heard him talk or just talk very little, I don't remember anymore as I have removed him from my friendlist a long time ago. He possesses decent knowledge about his main hero : Artanis but the worst part is he is too aggressive with his hero leading to many pointless deaths just because he decides to overstay and fight to his last breath instead of running away. Without a proper team to support his recklessness, I doubt he will have many wins on his own. He is not someone you want to play with if you can't or don't want to support him at a moment's notice. And oh, what is macro play when he just arams all days to stack his quest. I hate playing with him.
